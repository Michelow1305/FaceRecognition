# Welcome!
Here I play around with DeepFace

Check it out:

# What did I do here?
Currently, the program starts a webcam stream. After 3 seconds, it takes a snapshot and saves it temporarily.

That snapshot is then analyzed with deepface. I know deepface has its own function for a webcam stream, but I think it sucks.

After analyzing, the dominant values are printed and plots are made and shown in a new window. When the plot window is closed, it starts over!

# Thoughts for the future
I might use this for my homebrewn smart-home system using a raspi webcam, to detect me or my girl. Hope this runs on my raspi tho..
